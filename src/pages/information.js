<p>
I am Dominic Decarlo, a Visual Designer from San Francisco. Using my background of fine arts and my ongoing interest in problem solving, I work to employ rational, logical, and interesting approaches when making my work. I look for things to be fixed, whether it be my garden gate or a complex branding solution for a rising startup. I propose alternatives to existing models and challenge already established ideas of art direction and normative branding. I strive for clear and to the point work, creating conceptually logical solutions to any design problem and proposing them in a clear and easily understandable ways. I build work individually and in collaborative efforts, often leading teams on projects. Making connections with people through work to enable greater creative efforts is one of my greatest pleasures. Embracing the contradictions and dilemmas of other points of view will lead me to change my mind, go full circle, and arrive at the beginning with something great. My favorite color is opaque red found in water color palettes.

My name is Dominic Decarlo. I love to eat kale and pet dogs. Sometimes I double-fist kale and dog-petting when I'm upset. When I was young Jacob told me to treat people with respect and I took that advice with a grain of salt since he wasn't a very nice man.

As a designer I strive for utter chaos and confusion. If I can successfully disarm a person's sanity I have become their master and personal god. I would love to work with you! Please send me projects, I will do them, and you will pay me. It's a win-win situation. Much love and respect to you: my loyal fans and respected colleagues.
