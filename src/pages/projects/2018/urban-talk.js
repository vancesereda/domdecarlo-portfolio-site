<p><strong>Manifesto Poster<br />
</strong><br />
Using a supplied grid and text, I designed a layout to communicate the mood and message of 5 extremely different design manifestos. Using elements of design and a simplified style inspired by Keith Harings illustrations, I was able to create a poster which encapsulated not just the message of one of the design solutions prescribed, but the idea that all of these manifestos operated as a single world view, representing design as a solution to problems. <br />
